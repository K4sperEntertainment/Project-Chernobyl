# 26 April 1986
The Nuclear Power plant from Chernobyl, Kyiv Region of Ukraine has exploded. `31 People` confirmed that died in that disaster but the radiation has affected more than 31 people, entry Europe I can say. A lot of people were sent there to clean and the explication of that was the result of a `flawed reactor design that was operated with inadequately trained personnel.` The resulting steam explosion and fires released at least 5% of the radioactive reactor core into the environment, with the deposition of radioactive materials in many parts of Europe

# 23 September 1988
After digging and cleaning the area of radiation sight, 2 people have found a weird room that was not on the blueprint of the power plant. It had a very weird big door of a normal hallway that seemed to be not affected by the disaster from there. These guys have announced the discovery to the chief, but he and others didn't believe what they told him, also he refused to see with their own eyes because the radiation was still strong then. The 2 cleaners after being made fun of go on their own there. They enter that perfect and undamaged hallway but the door suddenly closes making a tight seal and then only a concrete wall can be seen and we didn't found or heard from that people since then. From that experience I have another idea of what it's happening, maybe if I will write more I will finally make you understand that Chernobyl wasn't a disaster.

(This is the last footage that I could find on my last day as a cleaner on 9 July 1996)
